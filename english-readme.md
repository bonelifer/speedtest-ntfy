# speedtest-ntfy
This batch script starts by displaying the computer's public IP address using the "ifconfig.me" service. It then runs an Internet speed test using the "speedtest" command and saves the results to a file called "speed.txt". Finally, it uses the "curl" command to upload the "speed.txt" file to a file hosting service called "ntfy.sh". The file is sent to a specific address "ntfy.sh/Alarmenoc".
